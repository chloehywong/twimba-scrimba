# Twitter Clone Project 

Developing a Twitter clone to render out some tweets from prepared data. Each of the tweets can be liked, commented and retweeted. Also, the user can create a new post. 

## Requirements
* No special requirements as this project is built from scratch with vanilla JS. Need improvement for UX experience in the future. 

## Netlify Deployment

This project uses [Continuous Deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment). In order to deploy the site using Netlify follow these steps:

* Create a new site by clicking the "Add new site" button.
* Push the repo to GitHub by linking Netlify to GitHub. 
* Select the "Authorize Application" button to allow Netlify to access your repository code. 
* Choose the repo that you would like to deploy from the list.
* Configure Your Settings and then click the "Deploy site" button to continue.
* All done! You can review the newly published site via the URL. 

Note: when you  create a Merge Request, Netlify will create a preview URL so you can check the changes on the browser.
